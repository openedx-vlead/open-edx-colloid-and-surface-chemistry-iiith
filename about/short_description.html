This lab is about colloidal systems. Milk, butter, ice-cream, body-spray, ink, shaving cream, glue, etc. are a few of numerous examples of colloids. We know that there are three fundamental states of matter: solids, liquids and gases. When matter in one of these states is dispersed in finely divided state in another, it is called a ‘colloidal system’.
