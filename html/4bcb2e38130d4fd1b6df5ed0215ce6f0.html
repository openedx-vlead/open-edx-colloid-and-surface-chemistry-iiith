<h3>Pre-Experiment</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>How can the size of the molecules be determined from their migration distance on the finished gel?</li>
<li>Is there any direct relationship between the molar mass and the size of these dye molecules? Illustrate.</li>
<li>What was direction of electron flow through the gel?</li>
<li>Why should one not touch the gel while the electrophoresis was running?</li>
<li>Can one use an alternating current (A.C.) power supply source for gel electrophoresis? Why?</li>
<li>Why do the charged particles in a well move during electrophoresis run?</li>
<li>What are the effects of variations in the applied voltage on the gel electrophoresis?</li>
<li>What is the function of the comb?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Post-Experiment</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Why does one see bubbles coming out in the electrode chambers?</li>
<li>Why had all the dyes not moved in the same direction through the gel?</li>
<li>Which of the dyes moved to the positive end of the gel?</li>
<li>What is the electrical charge adopted by Orange G under the experimental condition?</li>
<li>Which of the dyes were positively charged under the experimental condition?</li>
<li>Can one say which dye molecule has most likely the smallest size?</li>
<li>What would happen if one had placed the comb on the end/side slot of the casting tray?</li>
<li>If you wanted to run only DNA samples through the gel, where would you prefer to place the comb - on the middle or end slot of the tray and what should be the arrangement of the loading wells with respect to the electrodes?</li>
