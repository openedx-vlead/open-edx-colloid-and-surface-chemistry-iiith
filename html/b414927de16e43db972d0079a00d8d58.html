<p><strong> To start the experiment do the following: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Demonstration of the Tyndall effect is done here with the following six samples: pure water, salt solution, sugar solution, detergent solution, ferric hydroxide colloid, and silver colloid.</li>
<li>Prepare solutions of salt, sugar and detergent and colloids of ferric hydroxide and silver in water. [Refer to the preparation methodologies given in earlier experiments]. Here select one of the items from the top-left shelf by clicking on it and follow the instructions. In the case detergent solution, one should stir the mixture very gently to avoid bubble formation.</li>
<li>In a dark room, pass light through each of the six samples from a torch. Here to perform this step click on any one of the tagged samples on the table and observe.</li>
<li>Note down whether the sample shows the Tyndall effect or not and then conclude whether the sample is a pure liquid, true solution or a colloidal dispersion.</li>
<li>Verify your conclusions by selecting correct answer.</li>
<li>Click on OK tab on the result page and see the microscopic view.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps for all the other samples.</li>
