<h3>Pre-Experiment</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Define the parameter, &alpha;, in terms of particle diameter vs. wavelength and particle circumference vs. wavelength.</li>
<li>Why is the colour of the sky orange-red during the sunrise and sunset?</li>
<li>What will be scattering pattern for N2 molecule?</li>
<li>"When a white light beam is passed through a glass cube containing small dispersed particles, the cube appears either bluish or reddish when viewed from different directions." Justify it.</li>
<li>In the Rayleigh regime, compare scattering intensities of 450 nm wavelength (blue) and 650 nm (red) lights.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3>Post-Experiment</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>What happens if one stirs vigorously to dissolve soap powder in water?</li>
<li>Though smaller N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> molecules in the atmosphere can scatter light, why don't we see Tyndall effect in sugar solution which have larger sugar molecules?</li>
<li>What is the reason for showing Tyndall effect by soap solution?</li>
<li>Arrange the following three samples in increasing order of particle size: salt, detergent &amp; Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> colloid in water.</li>
<li>Do we always need colloids to observe the light scattering phenomenon?</li>
