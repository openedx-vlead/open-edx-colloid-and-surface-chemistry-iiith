<h3>Pre-Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li>What property of metal particles is used in the study of their formation kinetics?</li>
<li>Can one follow the reduction of eosin by borohydride by measuring the absorbance of gold particles and Why?</li>
<li>Why does one need to use gold particles in the reduction of eosin by sodium borohydride?</li>
<li>In how many ways may finely divided particles facilitate the catalysed reaction?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Post-Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do you observe any induction period for the commencement of eosin reduction reaction?</li>
<li>What happens to the color of gold particles after its participation in the catalysis?</li>
<li>What was the absorbance value of the gold seed particle solution?</li>
<li>What was the initial absorbance value of the reaction solution used for the reduction kinetics study?</li>
<li>How can one follow the reduction of eosin at &lambda;=535 nm near its maximum absorbance wavelength where gold nanoparticles also absorb light?</li>
<li>Why does the catalysed reaction rate varies for different sized particle samples, though the same quantity of gold and all other reactants are used?</li>
