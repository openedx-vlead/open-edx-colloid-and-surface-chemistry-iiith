<p><strong>To start the experiment do the following:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To make 100 ml of gel, take 1.0 g of agar powder in a 250 mL glass beaker and add 100 mL 1xTBE (Tris/Borate/EDTA) buffer to it (1% weight/volume agar gel). Heat in the microwave oven until the agar powder completely melts. (Refer to agar gel preparation experiment.)</li>
<li>Place appropriate comb at the middle slot of the tray for making wells at the centre of the gel.</li>
<li>Cool down the hot agar solution to ~60<sup>O</sup>C and then carefully pour it into the tray until the solution covers about 1/3 length of the teeth of the comb. Pull air bubbles, if any, towards the edges of the tray with help of a micropipette tip. Initial clear hot solution turns slightly opaque on setting into semi-solid gel.</li>
<li>Remove the comb carefully after the gel solidifies.</li>
<li>Place the gel tray into the electrophoresis chamber.</li>
<li>Gently pour 1xTBE buffer solution into each side of the chamber until the buffer just barely covers the top surface of the gel. If the gel tray or gel floats up, gently press down on the edges of the gel/tray until it sinks down to the platform.</li>
<li>Take 10 &mu;L of each dye including the dye mixture from the dye kit and load into one of the sample wells with the help of a micropipette. Note down the well/lane number and the name of the dye loaded into it. Each time use a new pipette tip to avoid contamination. The dye kit contains the following dyes: Bromophenol Blue, Janus Green, Orange G, Safranin O, Xylene Cyanol and a dye mixture (Table 1).</li>
<li>One should place the lid of electrophoresis chamber in position before connecting the wires to the power supply (here it is not shown).</li>
<li>Connect the electrodes to the power supply (with the power supply off). Match the red wire (positive end) to the red receptacle (positive) and the black wire (negative end) to the black (negative) receptacle.</li>
<li>Turn on the power supply and set the voltage to appropriate (constant) value. Do not touch or remove the chamber lid while the electric current is on.</li>
<li>Observe the movement of the dyes within the gel. Continue electrophoresis run until the fastest moving dye has migrated near to (~1 cm from) the end of the gel.</li>
<li>Turn off the power and disconnect the wires.</li>
<li>Before removing the lid, one should label the positive and negative ends of the gel and the lane number 1 to 5.</li>
<li>Removing the lid (not shown here) record the direction of movement and displacement of each dye from the origin (see Table 1).</li>
<li>Group the dyes based on the nature of the electrical charges adopted under the experimental conditions.</li>
<li>Assuming unit charge, list the dyes in order of increasing molecular size.</li>
<li>Identify the components of the unknown dye mixture.</li>
