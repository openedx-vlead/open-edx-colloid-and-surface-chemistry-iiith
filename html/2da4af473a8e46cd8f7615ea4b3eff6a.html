<div id="lab-article-section-6-content" class="content"><br /><b>Pre-experiment Quiz</b><ol><ol>
<li>How do stable assemblies of micelles form though the ionic head groups are supposed to repel each other?</li>
<li>How will the surface tension of a solution vary with the increase in surfactant concentration and why?</li>
<li>What will be the effects of larger head groups on micellar structure and aggregation number?</li>
<li>The aggregation numbers for nonionic surfactant molecules are often more than that for ionic surfactants. Why?</li>
<li>Which ion, the cation or the anion, of an anionic surfactant will reduce the surface tension of water when dissolved in it?</li>
</ol></ol><br /><b>Post-experiment Quiz</b><ol>
<li>Can one prepare ionic micelle below the Kraft Temperature?</li>
<li>Will there be formation of micelles if one dissolves more than the CMC of a surfactant all at once (not little by little) in water?</li>
<li>Once micelles have formed, can surfactant molecules of the micelle exchange with those of other micelles or free surfactant molecules present in solution?</li>
<li>Why do the organic substances dissolve into the core of the micelles?</li>
<li>Typically do the soaps/detergents form lather easily in surface water or in bore-well water and why?</li>
