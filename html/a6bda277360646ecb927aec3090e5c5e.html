<h3>Pre-Experiment</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>How will the micelle structure in nonpolar solvent be different from that in water?</li>
<li>How CMC value will be affected if an additive is used that decreases the dielectric constant of water?</li>
<li>Can one determine the CMC of a nonionic surfactant by conductivity measurement method?</li>
<li>What kind of current (d.c. vs. a.c.) is used in conductivity measurement?</li>
<li>CMCs of ionic surfactants are generally higher than the nonionic surfactants whereas aggregation numbers of ionic surfactants are generally smaller than the nonionic surfactants. Why?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Post-Experiment</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>What is the CMC of SDS?</li>
<li>Why the slopes of two straight lines above and below the CMC vary?</li>
<li>Why do we need to know the cell constant of the conductivity cell?</li>
<li>Under which condition the measured conductance of the solution is the same as the specific conductance?</li>
<li>The plot of &kappa; vs. surfactant concentration gives two straight lines with different slopes below and above the CMC. Which straight line has a smaller slope and why?</li>
<li>Using your experimentally determined CMC value and assuming a mean aggregation number of 80 for SDS micelles, estimate the micelle concentration, [micelle] for a bulk surfactant concentration of 0.080 M.</li>
<li>What is value of the CMC expressed as a mole fraction (X<sub>CMC</sub>)? (Hint: X<sub>CMC</sub>= (no. of mol of SDS at CMC)/( no. of mol of SDS at CMC + no. of mol of solvent)</li>
<li>Calculate the standard free energy change of micellisation, &Delta;G<sub>mic</sub>?</li>
