<p><strong>To start the experiment do the following: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Fill a clean beaker with purified water almost to the brim. [ Click on the beaker to start]</li>
<li>Sprinkle talcum powder on the water surface carefully to form a fine layer of powder. [Click on the talcum powder from the apparatus table]</li>
<li>Add only one drop of detergent solution in the middle of the water surface. Observe what happens. [Click on the detergent available on the apparatus table]</li>
<li>Fill another clean beaker with purified water almost to the brim. Float a small sewing needle on the surface of water by very carefully lowering it into the beaker (avoid disturbing the surface with your fingers). [Click to select the needle and add it from the apparatus shelf.]</li>
<li>Once you have a needle floating, add very gently a small drop of detergent solution away from the needle. Observe what happens. [To add, click on the detergent available on the shelf]</li>
<li>Use hard water instead of purified water and repeat steps 1, 2 and 3. Are the observations different from those with purified water? [Select the beaker by clicking on it and repeat the above procedure]</li>
<li>For the microscopic view of the observations, Click on the microscopic &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; tab at the end of the experiment.</li>
