<h3>Pre-Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li>Is gel a liquid-solid, solid-gas or liquid-gas system of colloids?</li>
<li>In colloidal gel system, which one &ndash; the dispersion medium or the dispersed medium &ndash; is more by volume and weight?</li>
<li>Why is gel-colloid called a pseudo solid mass?</li>
<li>What contributes towards the hardness and stickiness of a gel?</li>
<li>What is the size of the interstitial pockets of the agar-agar network structure?</li>
<li>What happens to the network mesh size on increasing the concentration of agar?</li>
<li>"Edible jelly has approximately the density of water." Justify.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Post-Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li>Can one use buffer solution of any pH for the preparation of agar gel?</li>
<li>How will the gel property change if the concentration of buffer solution is increased?</li>
<li>Why should one remove the flask from microwave at regular intervals and swirl it gently?</li>
<li>How can one avoid bubble formation in the gel matrix?</li>
<li>What are the temperatures of gelation and gel melting?</li>
