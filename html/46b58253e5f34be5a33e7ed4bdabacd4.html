<h3>Pre-Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you cut a cube of 1 cm edge length into a cube of 1 micrometer edge length, how many cubes will be formed from the original cube?</li>
<li>What will be increase in surface area after forming the smaller cubes in the above question?</li>
<li>How does the surface area affect the reaction rate?</li>
<li>Why do the properties of small particles differ from their bulk counterparts?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Post-Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li>Why do you expect the citrate-stabilized sols are more stable against coagulation than borohydride-stabilized ones?</li>
<li>How does the higher temperature (100oC) help in Ag colloid preparation?</li>
<li>Which metal -Ag or Hg- has the higher position in the electrochemical series?</li>
<li>Why does silver chloride precipitate appear from silver colloid upon reacting with mercuric chloride?</li>
