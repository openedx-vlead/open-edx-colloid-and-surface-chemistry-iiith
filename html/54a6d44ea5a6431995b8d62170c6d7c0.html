<h3>Pre-Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li>Why is the surface of a liquid destabilised relative to the bulk?</li>
<li>Does a molecule in the body of a &lsquo;polar liquid&rsquo; experience forces of attraction uniformly in all directions?</li>
<li>Which one is easier &ndash; to move an object through the surface or to move it when it is completely submersed and why?</li>
<li>Why does the surface tension decrease with increase in temperature?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Post-Experiment</h3>
<ol>
<li>How were the observations of the experiment with distilled water different from that with hard water?</li>
<li>Why should one not drop the detergent solution near the floating needle?</li>
<li>Why do the powder flakes move towards the edges of the beaker on addition of drops of detergent solution?</li>
<li>Why do soap bubbles last for long times whereas bubbles in pure water often burst and disappear quickly?</li>
<li>Why does hard water require more detergents or soaps to form leather?</li>
