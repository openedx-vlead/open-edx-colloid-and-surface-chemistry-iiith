<p><strong>To start the experiment do the following: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare about 20 mL of a concentrated FeCl<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O solution (by dissolving it in about three times its volume of deionized water).</li>
<li>Take a 1 L conical flask (by clicking on it) and pour about 500 mL of deionized water in the flask.</li>
<li>Place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer-cum-heater.</li>
<li>Set the heater temperature to 100&deg;C (by clicking on the Heater knob)</li>
<li>Place a magnetic bar into the flask and set the stirrer to a medium speed.</li>
<li>When the water in the flask starts boiling, turn off the heater.</li>
<li>Use a dropper to add some of the original concentrated FeCl<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O solution to the hot water, a few drops at a time. Note down your observation. Then one has to switch off the stirrer.</li>
<li>Take rest of the solution in the beaker and apply heat on it until it boils. Note down your observation.</li>
<li>Add a few mL of FeCl<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O solution to the above beaker and stir it. Note down your observation.</li>
<li>Filter the solutions first using filter paper and then cellophane. Note down your observation.</li>
